# Contributing to Eclipse 4diac

Thanks for your interest in this project.

## Project Description

Eclipse 4diac is a Open Source Framework for Industrial Automation & Control. 
It is a reference implementation for the IEC 61499 standard. 
IEC 61499 defines a domain specific modeling language for developing distributed industrial control solutions.
IEC 61499 extends IEC 61131-1 by improving the encapsulation of software components for increased re-usability, providing a vendor independent format, and simplifying support for controller to controller communication.
Its distribution functionality and the inherent support for dynamic reconfiguration provide the required infrastructure for Industrie 4.0 and industrial IoT applications.
